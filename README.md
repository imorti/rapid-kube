A quick way to get started with kubernetes, minikube and kube-prompt


# Overview
In this tutorial, we're going to setup ```minikube``` on our local machine. We're going to examine where ```minikube``` stores it's configuration. We'll then make use of a tool called ```kube-prompt``` to save ourselves from typing ```kubectl``` on every command. We'll set up some monitoring using ```Heapster```. Finally, we'll get used to using a package manager called ```helm```.
